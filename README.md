# React-Portfolio

## Description
This is my react portfolio that I made the show my future employers the work I've done during this cohort.
This assignment mimics the first portfolio I had to make but instead it's made using react, which can show any employers
my capabilities. This app contains a About, Contact, and Portfolio sections that all have the content a employer would like to see
when viewing my site.

## Usage
This app taught me how much easier it was to build a portfolio using react than plain old 
html and css and basic javascript. Using react helps implement things easier and quicker that for sure took less time and 
frustation to do. An employer can browse my site and interact with it as well as view my projects to see what I'm
capable of.
